                <h5 className="card-title">Why Choose Us ?</h5>
                <p className="card-text">Nifa teaches its students realistic drawing and painting, which helps in strengthening confidence. Nifa's instructions help students avoid continual dissatisfaction with their artistic abilities, so that they will not eventually give up pursuing art as a viable interest. Drawing and painting are learned subjects, just like any other. Nifa takes a very classical approach in teaching drawing and painting. What it means is that instructions coupled with practice, will bring about an independent and confident artist in you. Students have worked for years before they ever became "masters" themselves. After months with Nifa, students and their families are constantly amazed at their new abilities, and that it is real fun to learn how to draw and paint.</p>

Work will challenge you, and your studies will stretch your mind. The rewards, though, are enormous and the company exhilarating. Whichever you choose, studying at NIFA will help you achieve your aspirations.</p>
